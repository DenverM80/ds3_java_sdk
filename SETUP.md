## Setup

In order to get started developing with the ds3_java_sdk you need to make sure that you have completed the following:

* Install the latest version of the [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) **NOTE:** Make sure to select the correct version for your platform
* Install the latest version of [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* Download and extract the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).  Download `Eclipse IDE for Java Developers`, it should be the first download option
* Once Eclipse has been extracted to a directory of your choosing, navigate to that directory and start Eclipse.  On Windows you will see `eclipse.exe`
*
